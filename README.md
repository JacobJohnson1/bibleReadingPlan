Here's a lil python script to make a bible reading plan pdf! 

For 2026, I wanted to use the plan outlined in [this video](https://youtu.be/sU5ygB2s8PU?si=wBT6wAx-PVxKWjeh). 
@JohnPMiles outlined the sections & didn't create the doc as a daily reading plan to fit into one year, but that's what this repo is for.
